          <h3>Install an extension</h3>

          <p>
            To start sending data to Langkeeper you need to install an extension
            in your favorite text editor.
          </p>

          <p>We support Neovim and vscode.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>vscode</h3>

          <p>
            Search for <code>vscode-langkeeper</code> on the extension
            marketplace and install it.
          </p>

          <p>
            After installing the extension, you need to configure it with your
            credentials. You can start the set up process by running the
            <code>Langkeeper: Setup</code> command.
          </p>

          <img
            src="/images/vscode_palette.gif"
            alt="Opening palette and running setup demostration"
          />

          <p>
            The server URL is the URL of your Langkeeper instance. If you are
            using the hosted version, you can leave it as it is. Otherwise, you
            need to change it to your server URL.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now you are all set up! You can start sending data to Langkeeper by
            saving a file with a recognized extension. (e.g. <code>.js</code>)
